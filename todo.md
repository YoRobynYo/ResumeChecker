# AI Resume Assistant Architecture - Todo List

## when starting the app do the following 

## when starting the app do the following 

1. in this app opened in vs code 
2. you need to open the app then open 4 terminals 
3. terminal 1 - cd backend  > source venv/bin/activate 
(once activated add) python app.py 
3.a to stop using env to get to root use deactivate
4. terminal 2 - cd frontend > npm start
5. terminal 3 - psql postgres (this runs the server on the desktop)
6. terminal 4 - ollama run llama3 (this runs the AI)
7. if llama has been reset for any reason restart in terminal and check the status update 

**Tip:**  
If you change images, CSS, or JS and don’t see updates in your browser
This forces the browser to reload everything and ignore cached files.
**hard refresh on mac**: `Cmd + Shift + R`  

open the postgres app - pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start
sometimes this works after opening the database / in terminal :: psql postgres

p/w frontend cd frontend :: npm run start / production :: npm run build 
p/w backend cd backend :: flask run (starts python)
p/w postgres server :: start the separate server of choice (resumechecker is our app) 
p/w postgres server :: open a new terminal // psql -d resumechecker -U postgres -W ()


NEXT STEPS
updated list on what's to do 
🧠 AI + LLM Features (Core Assistant Functionality)

Integrate LangChain on backend.

Set up Ollama LLM locally for resume analysis and feedback generation.

Extract text from uploaded PDF resumes.

    Analyze text using LLM and return improvement suggestions.

🗃️ Vector Database Setup

Set up pgvector in PostgreSQL for similarity search.

Generate and store embeddings for uploaded resumes.

    Enable vector-based resume comparison/querying.

💬 Chat Interface (AI Resume Assistant)

Add AI chat interface to React frontend.

Create backend route to handle chat queries via LangChain.

    Allow user to chat with the AI about their uploaded resume.

💵 Monetization & Accounts

Add user authentication (basic login/signup).

Add payment tier logic: Standard (£29.99) and Pro (£49.99).

Lock certain AI features behind Pro tier.

    Track usage to charge for extra features (e.g., resume reviews).

📦 Deployment & Hosting

Prepare production build of frontend.

Deploy backend and database on Heroku or Render.

Host frontend on GitHub Pages or Netlify.

    Set up custom domain.

🧾 Bonus Feature Notes (From Today)

Auto-open PDF after upload instead of showing link.

Add loader/spinner while uploading or analyzing.

Improve error messages and UI alerts.

Provide download button for AI-annotated resume (PDF).


###### whats to do #######

🧽 1. Frontend Cleanup / Landing Page

    Style the app like the layout you want (waiting for your screenshot upload)

    Add branding, fonts, testimonials (if any), and benefits

    Add a pricing section (optional for now — can be manual PayPal for launch)

🔐 2. Authentication (optional)

    If you want users to log in (email + password), we can use Firebase/Auth0 or keep it public for launch

💳 3. Payment Integration (optional)

    Stripe or simple “Buy Now” button that unlocks access to premium uploads

🧪 4. Final Testing

    Upload test

    AI chat test

    Cross-device (mobile, desktop)

    Error handling tidy up

🚀 5. Go Live

    Deploy backend (e.g., Render, Railway, or Heroku Free)

    Deploy frontend (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages if static)

    Hook the frontend to the new backend URL

    ## update on the list

    Workflow Plan
1. Pre-Upload Payment Wall

    Show a landing message: “Upload your resume for an AI-powered review – £29.99”

    Use a payment gateway (like Stripe)

    Only after successful payment: show the upload form

2. LLaMA Review & Analysis

    Upload goes to app.py via /upload endpoint

    LLaMA checks the resume and generates analysis

    Show analysis (e.g., missing keywords, tone issues, format tips)

3. Offer Paid Upgrade

    Show a section titled: “✨ Get a Pro Resume Upgrade”

    List what’s included:

        Enhanced wording

        ATS-friendly formatting

        Rewritten summary/objective

        Bullet point clarity

        New layout style

    Price: £49.99

    Payment button → on success, trigger full rewrite via LLaMA and return downloadable version


.... list on whats left to do ...

✅ What You’ve Done:

    Frontend layout using React + Tailwind CSS

    Working image background setup via /public/images

    Upload form (presumably connected to backend or ready to be)

    Payment logic stub (hasPaid state toggled by Pay button)

    Conditional rendering based on payment status

🛠️ What's Probably Left To Do:
🔌 1. Upload Backend Integration

    Connect the UploadForm component to your Flask backend.

    Ensure file upload works (sending resume to server).

    Confirm it triggers resume improvement via your AI logic.

🧠 2. AI Resume Analysis

    Call your LangChain/Ollama backend after upload.

    Display the AI's response (e.g., improved resume, feedback).

    You might want a loading spinner while the AI is processing.

💳 3. Payment Integration (Optional)

    If you plan to go live with payments: integrate Stripe or similar.

    For now, your hasPaid mock works for testing UI flow.

📦 4. Backend Clean-Up & Testing

    Ensure Flask backend works end-to-end with file input.

    Connect PostgreSQL + pgvector if you’re using embedding search.

    Test locally with real resumes.

🌐 5. Hosting & Deployment

    Deploy frontend (e.g., Vercel or Netlify).

    Deploy Flask backend (e.g., Heroku or Render).

    Make sure frontend connects to backend via .env variables.

🔒 6. Basic Access Control

    Optional: add basic auth or gated access for paying users.

🚀 Ready for Launch Once:

File uploads work and are stored or analyzed

AI generates real output

UI feels clean + functional
